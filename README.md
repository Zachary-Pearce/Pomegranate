Choosing a processor for an embedded system is a delicate balancing act between flexibility and performance, however if a reconfigurable processor core was available and accessible then the cost of designing such systems would decrease as an existing design could be easily modified to fit an applcation and changed in the future if needs change.

Pomegranate is an open source soft-core processor written in VHDL. The goal of Pomegranate is to provide an accessible and easy to configure processor core that can be used in a varierty of embedded systems.

# Welcome
First of all, welcome to Pomegranate. This project started as my undergraduate thesis, I wanted it to become more than I could make it on my own so I started this repository. The name "Pomegranate" came from a friend, a name I ended up accepting as I felt it fit the project very well. A pomegranate is made up of many seeds and those same seeds can also be used to grow a new pomegranate. In the same way, two processor can be RISC processors but be made of different modules.

To get started, I reccomend that you start familiarising yourself with the wiki which covers:
- Link 1 (Pomegranate's mission, and how it seeks to achieve it)
- Link 2 (architecture details; instruction set, base architecture)
- Link 3 (configuring Pomegranate)
- Link 4 (programming Pomegranate)

## What if I don't know VHDL?
This might be a silly question to answer as most people that stumble upon this repository are likely to be looking for VHDL projects. However, if you happen to stumble upon this repository and appreciate it's vision then don't let the barrier of learning VHDL stop you, Pomegranate itself is a powerful tool but it can also be used to aid education. It is designed so you don't need to be a professional VHDL design engineer to configure it, the best practice is by doing.

If you are in higher education, it's likely you have free access to VHDL books you can learn from, that's exactly what I did to learn VHDL before my undergraduate thesis, I wasn't exactly an expert when I started the project.

I want to also extend this concept to those who want to get into designing processors, it may seem like an incredibly complex thing. But like all things, if you break it down, it gets easier. And once again, Pomegranate can be used as an educational tool, so I actively want to encourage newcomers to use this project to learn.

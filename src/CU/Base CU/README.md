# Control Unit

## Design and Justification
<!-- Please discuss your design here -->
<!-- Make sure to justify any design choices made where there may be an alternative approach -->
The control unit is a purely combinational machine that takes the opcode being executed and tells each module what it should do using control signals. The control signals asserted for any given instruction is defined by the following truth table.

This code of conduct applies to all of us; users, contributers, and maintainers. It is written with the sole intent to make this community as welcoming as possible for all.

While this code of conduct can only reliably be enforced in spaces related to the Pomegranate project, please remember that you may be representing the community when you are communicating with those outside of it. As such, if a community member is found outwardly violating this code of conduct elsewhere for the purpose of harming someone in the community or outside of it, that person's ability to participate in the project may be affected.

# The Pomegranate Code
Please remember to always be:
1. **P**atient and friendly - Not everyone coming here is an expert and HDL languages are not exactly common place. This is not stack overflow so please answer questions without sarcasm.
2. **O**pen-minded - The community as a whole will never completely agree. Be accepting of the ideas of others. You should try to understand why their view differs, you may come around to their idea or vice versa.
3. **M**indful - Discussions are had with people, not just numbers and letters on a screen. The words you say affect people and we ask that you conduct yourself professionally. Examples of unprofessional behaviour include but are not limited to:
    - Violent threats directed at an individual.
    - Discriminatory jokes and language (e.g. slurs, stereotype jokes).
    - Posting NSFW material.
    - Sexual harassment.
    - Bullying.
4. **E**ngaged - If you see something, say something. I am one person and will likely miss examples of misconduct, it is always best to report incidents to me directly and direct communication with me will always be open.
5. **G**
6. **R**
7. **A**
8. **N**
9. **A**
10. **T**
11. **E**

<sub>I ran out of traits. Actually, having 11 rules would be kinda intimidating huh.</sub>

Breaking any of the rules above won't necessarily result in an immediate ban, I reserve the right to adjust the consequences based on severity and any past incidents.

# Reporting
If you believe that someone is violating the code of conduct please let me (Zach :D) know via email ([zachary.pearce25@gmail.com]) or another appropriate channel. However, I am more likely to see emails. No matter how you contact me, I must be able to contact you myself if I need further details.

There are 3 things that I pledge I will do when an incident is reported to me:
1. Keep you anonymous.
2. Be fair.
3. Resolve the situation to the best of my ability.

I may ask further questions or ask for examples of the behaviour, this is not because I don't believe you. I need to ensure no one abuses the code of conduct to remove others from the community and I must issue fair consequences.

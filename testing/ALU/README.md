<!-- Please make sure to give a brief description of the simulation test cases -->

## Resource Utilization

<!-- This does not show all of the resources you could use, just the most common ones... -->
<!-- Feel free to add more rows to the table if needed -->
| Resource | Amount Used |
| --- | :---: |
| LUT | 0 |
| FF | 0 |
| I/O | 0 |
| BUFG | 0 |

## Timing Reports

<!-- In this section, please present the timing characteristics of the design -->
| Net | Minimum (ns) | Maximum (ns) |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Logic | 0 | 0 |

### Maximum clock frequency

```math
\text{Maximum clock frequency (GHz)} = \frac{1}{\text{Maximum logic delay (ns)}}
```

Using the above equation, we can find the maximum clock frequency: $[\text{insert result here}]\text{GHz}$

> [!NOTE]
> The maximum clock frequency also applies to purely combinational designs as this will tell us the maximum clock frequency of processors the design is used in

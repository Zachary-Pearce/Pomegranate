## Resource Utilization

<!-- This does not show all of the resources you could use, just the most common ones... -->
<!-- Feel free to add more rows to the table if needed -->
| Resource | Amount Used |
| --- | :---: |
| LUT | 0 |
| FF | 0 |
| I/O | 0 |
| BUFG | 0 |

## Timing Reports

<!-- In this section present the timing characteristics of the design -->
| Net | Minimum (ns) | Maximum (ns) |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Clock | 0 | 0 |
| Logic | 0 | 0 |

### Maximum clock frequency

```math
\begin{align}
&\text{Maximum clock frequency (GHz)} = \frac{1}{\text{Maximum logic delay}} && (1)
\end{align}
```
